# Virtual Classroom Platform - Bridging the Rural-Urban Learning Gap (SIH - 2025)


## üí° Introduction

**Problem Statement**: Rural diploma colleges in India lack specialized lecturers in fields like AI and VLSI due to infrastructure limitations, specifically low and unstable internet speeds. Traditional video conferencing platforms are unreliable, deepening the urban-rural learning gap. The challenge is to create a sustainable, low-bandwidth, and user-friendly virtual classroom that provides access to quality education for students in these areas.

**Solution**: Our solution is a software-only, three-sided virtual classroom platform designed to be lightweight and accessible on entry-level smartphones, addressing the core issue of poor connectivity and expensive hardware. By prioritizing clear audio and highly compressed visual content, our platform functions smoothly even on 2G/3G networks while providing live sessions, recorded lectures, interactive elements, and professional development opportunities for educators and students alike.
