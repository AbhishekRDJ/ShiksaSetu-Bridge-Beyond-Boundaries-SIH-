Problem Statement
Rural diploma colleges in India lack specialized lecturers in fields like AI and VLSI due to infrastructure limitations, specifically low and unstable internet speeds. Traditional video conferencing platforms are unreliable, deepening the urban-rural learning gap. The challenge is to create a sustainable, low-bandwidth, and user-friendly virtual classroom that provides access to quality education for students in these areas.

Proposed Solution
Our solution is a software-only, three-sided virtual classroom platform. It is designed to be lightweight and accessible on entry-level smartphones, addressing the core issue of poor connectivity and expensive hardware.

Key Features:
Low-Bandwidth Optimization: The platform prioritizes clear audio and highly compressed visual content to function smoothly even on 2G/3G networks.

Live & Asynchronous Learning: Teachers can conduct live lectures, which are automatically recorded. These recordings are stored in a small-sized format for students to watch later or download during off-peak hours.

Three User Roles:

Teacher: A dedicated profile for educators to go live, manage playlists of their lectures, and interact with students.

Student: A simplified interface to join live sessions, watch recorded videos, and download learning materials.

Admin: Manages the platform, user accounts, and content.

Interactive Elements: Quizzes, polls, and a comment section with a built-in LLM (like ChatGPT) to answer student questions, ensuring continuous engagement.

Professional Development for Teachers: Teachers are motivated through a unique profile-building system. Their profile is a public record of their teaching hours and student engagement. Achieving milestones earns them digital certifications that can be shared on platforms like LinkedIn, providing professional recognition and a tangible incentive.

Career Integration: A dedicated section to list job and internship opportunities, connecting students with potential employers and bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

Gamification: A leaderboard and a certification system to recognize and reward student progress, encouraging continuous learning.

Technical Design (High-Level)
The platform is built as a lightweight ecosystem to ensure minimal data consumption and high performance on basic devices.

Frontend: A simple, intuitive user interface optimized for entry-level smartphones. It prioritizes essential functions and a clean design to reduce data load.

Backend: The backend is designed for efficiency, focusing on audio-first streaming and aggressive video compression. It handles user authentication, content storage, and database management. The recording function is automated, and file compression is a key process to ensure small download sizes.

Core Modules:

Authentication & User Management: Secure registration and login for all three user roles.

Live Session Module: Handles the real-time audio and compressed video streaming.

Content Management System (CMS): Stores and organizes recorded lectures, learning materials, and teacher-uploaded content.

AI Integration: The LLM is integrated via an API to provide instant answers and study guidance to students.

Career Portal: A module to display and manage job/internship listings.

Gamification Engine: Tracks student and teacher progress, managing leaderboards and certification issuance.

Future Enhancements
Offline Mode: Allow students to sync content while on a stable connection and access it offline.

Peer-to-Peer Learning: Enable students to collaborate and form study groups within the platform.

Multilingual Support: Implement support for regional languages to make the platform more accessible to a wider audience.

Partnerships: Collaborate with NGOs and industry experts to provide a wider range of high-quality courses and learning resources.

Monetization for Sustainability: Explore sustainable revenue models, such as partnerships with universities or companies, to support platform maintenance without charging the students or teachers.  npm install npm@latest -g
